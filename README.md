# Better WIT Timetable ![preact](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-preact-blueviolet)

This is a nicer timetable for WIT. It's a work in progress, so it's not perfect yet.

The goal of the project is to make a timetable that is more user friendly and easier to use. It's also a good project for me to try Preact.

I wanted to focus on one main aspect: Only show what you need. This is why you can hide modules and only see what is on during one day at a time.

The app uses the timetable JSON generated from my [WIT Timetable Generator](https://github.com/piotrpdev/WIT-Timetable-Generator), this is much nicer than having to manually generate your timetable every week.
